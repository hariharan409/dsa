## ALGORITHMS AND THE DEFINITIONS

**Floyds Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm : 
**

It is a two-pointer technique used to detect cycles in a sequence, typically within a linked list. The algorithm is efficient, running in O(n) time with O(1) space, making it a popular choice for this kind of problem.

How Floyds Cycle-Finding Algorithm Works Initialization:

You have two pointers, commonly called the tortoise (slow pointer) and the hare (fast pointer).
Both pointers start at the head of the linked list.
Movement:

The tortoise moves one step at a time (tortoise = tortoise.next).
The hare moves two steps at a time (hare = hare.next.next).
